<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## TL;DR
- This project is intended for use in environments where sharing the same equipments among multiple people is required. For example, laboratory equipment, server nodes, room reservations and so on.
- We would like to relieve the stress of having to negotiate or speculate other peoples reservation.
   - **Make Reservations** in Google Calendar
   - **Check other users' reservations** in Google Calendar.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Setting Up (administrator side)
1. Create a Google account
2. Create a Google Group
   1. Change the settings to maximum security in every aspect such as messaging, viewing uses,...
   2. Enable group joining without admin permission
3. Create a spreadsheet following the format of `equipmentSettings.xlsx`
   1. Create 18 calendars in Google Calendar
   2. For every calendar, set modification priveledge to Google Group users
   3. write the calendar ids into `Write Calendar id` and `Read Calendar id` rows in sheets
   4. write the calendar urls into sheet named `URL of Calendar`
4. Create a GAS Project 
   1. Copy the contents of `equipmentReservation.js` to the new project's source code
   2. In the script, change {spreadsheetId} to your spreadsheet id, and {logSpreadsheetId} to your log spreadsheet id
5. In the GAS project, run the function CreateTriggers()
6. Publish the project

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

### Observing reservations (Write calendar)
1. Observe events on Google Calendar
2. Event title is `[Name] [Device] [State]`.
3. If there are too many reservations and it is overwhelming, you can hide the Read calendar in your calendar app and view it only when you need to.

>The implementations details are in [details (Japanese)](https://github.com/rayanti/equipment-reservation/blob/master/details.md).

## Usage
- The equiment reservation infos are shown (as events) in Google Calendar. Clients will check the reservations on their PCs or phones, and make a reservation at an avaliable time (by creating events).
- Settings like display name, what equipments to show in Google Calendar are saved in a Google Sheet.
## About The Project
- This project uses a service called [Google Apps Script(GAS)](https://script.google.com/home/start). GAS enables Google services to be connected by scripts. We will use Google Sheets and Google Calendar in this project.
- The language used in GAS is JavaScript with V8 syntax (V8 is a runtime which is used in Chrome and Node.js).
- Sheets acts as a database for user information, preferences and logging. Calendar acts as an UI and is used for adding, modifying, reviewing event.
- There are two types of calendars we will use. The write calendar will be modified by the clients. The read calendar will be modified by the GAS service. When an event is modified on a write calendar, GAS applies the modification on the read calendar.
