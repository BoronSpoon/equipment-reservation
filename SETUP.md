### 6. Observing reservations (Write calendar)
1. Observe events on Google Calendar
2. Event title is `[Name] [Device] [State]`.
3. If there are too many reservations and it is overwhelming, you can hide the Read calendar in your calendar app and view it only when you need to.

### 7. Writing experiment conditions (Experiment Sheets)
1. Open Experiment Sheets
2. Find the current event that you created in Google Calendar
3. Write experiment conditions in Sheets
4. The conditions will automatically get updated to the event in Google \Calendar.

## Usage
- The equiment reservation infos are shown (as events) in Google Calendar. Clients will check the reservations on their PCs or phones, and make a reservation at an avaliable time (by creating events).
- Settings like display name, what equipments to show in Google Calendar are saved in a Google Sheet.
## About The Project
- This project uses a service called [Google Apps Script(GAS)](https://script.google.com/home/start). GAS enables Google services to be connected by scripts. We will use Google Sheets and Google Calendar in this project.
- The language used in GAS is JavaScript with V8 syntax (V8 is a runtime which is used in Chrome and Node.js).
- Sheets acts as a database for user information, preferences and logging. Calendar acts as an UI and is used for adding, modifying, reviewing event.
- There are two types of calendars we will use. The write calendar will be modified by the clients. The read calendar will be modified by the GAS service. When an event is modified on a write calendar, GAS applies the modification on the read calendar.
